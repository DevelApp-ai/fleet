# Troubleshooting

## Where to look

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Everything fleet does (spawns, sends, status changes, tmux errors, caught panics) | `~/.fleet/logs/fleet.log` |
| `make test` output | `~/.fleet/logs/test.log` |
| `make dev` build and test results | `~/.fleet/logs/dev.log` |
| Agent state | `~/.fleet/board.json` |
| Status history | `~/.fleet/events.jsonl` |

`FLEET_HOME` moves all of these. Each log line has a `component=` attribute (`fleet`, `status`, `tmux`, `ui`, `wall`, `up`, `board`):

```sh
tail -f ~/.fleet/logs/fleet.log
grep 'component=status' ~/.fleet/logs/fleet.log | tail
```

## First checks

```sh
fleet ls                      # status of every agent
fleet ls --json               # full board entries
fleet peek <name>             # the agent's screen as fleet sees it
fleet peek <name> -n 200      # plus 200 lines of scrollback
fleet profiles                # effective profiles after tools.toml
tmux -L fleet ls              # is the fleet server running?
tmux -L fleet list-panes -a -F '#{pane_id} #{@role} #{@fleet_agent} #{pane_dead}'
```

## Common problems

**An agent shows the wrong status.** Status is a guess from the last six non-empty lines of the pane (see [profiles.md](profiles.md#status-patterns-fleetpatternstoml)). Limits:

- Tool UIs change; a new prompt or spinner may not match the built-in patterns. Run `fleet peek <name>`, then add a pattern in `~/.fleet/patterns.toml`.
- With no match, any change in the pane counts as working, and no change keeps the previous status. A tool that redraws a clock or cursor can look busy forever.
- Stuck means "working but the screen hasn't changed for 10 minutes". Long silent builds show as stuck.
- `waiting` patterns such as `(?i)approve` can match ordinary output that happens to be on the bottom lines.
- Only the fake agent has recorded test captures (`internal/status/testdata`). The copilot, claude, agy and vibe patterns are not yet checked against recorded screens; agy and vibe least of all.

**`unknown profile`.** Run `fleet profiles`. Check the section name in `~/.fleet/tools.toml`; a parse error there is reported as `tools.toml: …`.

**The agent exits at once / the pane shows `process exited`.** The command was not found or failed. Panes stay open after exit (`remain-on-exit`), so read the error with `fleet peek <name>`. Agents start through `bash -lc`, so aliases don't apply and `PATH` comes from your login shell.

**`Enter` in the overview says the wall needs `fleet up`.** The wall only works when the overview runs inside the fleet tmux server. Use `fleet up`, not `fleet ui` in a plain terminal.

**The admiral has no fleet tools.** `fleet up` passes the MCP server to it on the command line, so check the admiral's argv in `fleet.log` (`component=up`). Tools only work under a `copilot` or `claude` profile; with any other profile (including `fake`) the admiral is an ordinary agent. `fleet admiral` shows the current profile and session.

**The overview pane is gone or dead.** Run `fleet up` again. It recreates or respawns the overview pane and doesn't touch running agents.

**An agent is listed as `gone`.** Its pane no longer exists (closed outside fleet, or the server was restarted). `fleet close <name>` removes it from the board.

**Start over.** `tmux -L fleet kill-server` stops every agent and the admiral. Then delete `~/.fleet/board.json` if you want an empty board.
